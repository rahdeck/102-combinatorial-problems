### Problem

Let *n* be an odd integer greater than 1. Prove that the sequence:

$$\binom{n}{1}, \binom{n}{2},\dots,\binom{n}{\frac{n-1}{2}}$$

contains an odd number of odd numbers. 

### Solution

A look at the values of a full sequence from $\binom{n}{0}$ to $\binom{n}{n}$ should hopefully be instructive. Let's say that n = 9, then the sequence is 

$$1, 9, 36, 84, 126, 126, 84, 36, 9, 1$$
The sum of the whole sequence is $2^n = 2^9 = 512$. More generally, the sum of the sequence for any n > 0 is always going to be a power of 2, so an even number.

The sum of the first half of the sequence, from $\binom{9}{0}$ to $\binom{9}{4}$, (1, 9, 36, 84, 126) is therefore also an even number, $\frac{2^9}{2} = 2^8$.

However, we were told to skip the first value ($\binom{9}{0} = 1$) and start with $\binom{9}{1}$ and go until $\binom{9}{4}$. The result will be an odd number since an even number minus one gives an odd number. For a sum of any numbers to be odd, it must have an odd number of odd numbers.
