### Problem

Let S be a set with six elements. In how many different ways can one select two not necessarily distinct subsets of S so that the union of the two subsets is S? The order of the selection does not matter; for example the pair of subsets {a, c}, {b, c, d, e, f} represents the same selection as the pair {b, c, d, e}, {a, c}.

### Solution

For a 6-set it's:

$$\binom{6}{0} \cdot 2^5 + \binom{6}{1} \cdot 2^4 +\binom{6}{2} \cdot 2^3 +\binom{6}{3} \cdot 2^2 +\binom{6}{4} \cdot 2^1 +\binom{6}{5} \cdot 2^0 +\binom{6}{6} = `r sum(choose(6, 0:5) * 2^(5:0)) + 1`$$

which happens to be $\frac{3^6 + 1}{2} = `r (3^6+1)/2`$. There is something more to discover here... (for a 4-set it's 41 which also happens to be $\frac{3^4+1}{2}$)
