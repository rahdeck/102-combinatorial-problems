### Problem

In a room containing N people, N > 3, at least one person has not shaken hands with everyone else in the room. What is the maximum number of people in the room that could have shaken hands with everyone else?

### Solution

$N - 2$. That's because that person who hasn't shaken hands with at least one other person in the room must have had an "accomplice", i.e. the person they have not shaken hands with.
