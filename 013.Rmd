### Problem

Find the number of ordered quadruples ($x_1, x_2 , x_3, x_4$) of positive odd integers that satisfy $x_1, x_2 , x_3, x_4 = 98$.

### Solution

$\binom{48}{3}$ is the number of all ordered quadruples of positive _even_ integers that add up to 98. This is because there are $\frac{98}{2} - 1 = `r 98/2 - 1`$ positions into which we can put the bars to split 98 into four even-sized chunks (I would call them even 4-compositions of 98). These positions are between 2 and 3, 4 and 5, 6 and 7, etc.

For odd integers, we shift the positions to the left by one and get one more position to choose from, for the total number of $\binom{49}{3} = `r choose(49, 3)`$ ordered quadruples. These positions are between 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, etc.
