### Problem

A child has a set of 96 distinct blocks. Each block is of one of 2 materials (plastic, wood), 3 sizes (small, medium, large), 4 colors (blue, green, red, yellow), and 4 shapes (circle, hexagon, square, triangle). How many blocks in the set are different from the “plastic medium red circle” in exactly two ways? (The “wood medium red square” is such a block.)

### Solution

Zero ways: $1$

One way: $1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 9$

Two ways: $2 + 3 + 3 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 3 = 29$

Three ways: $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 + 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 + 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 + 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 39$

Four ways: $1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 18$

The total adds up to 96.
